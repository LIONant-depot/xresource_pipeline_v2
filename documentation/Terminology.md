# *Terminology*

# `Asset`
An asset is a source file used to generate a resource. These files are usually binary and created 
or exported by third-party tools like Photoshop, Maya, etc. 
They are designed to be easily readable by many tools, not for performance or real-time use. 
These files are checked into source control.

## Types of Assets:
* Images
    * png
    * tga
    * etc.
* Meshes
    * fbx
    * obj
    * etc.
* Fonts 
    * ttf
    * etc.
* etc.

# `Resource`
A resource is a file that has been processed by a resource compiler. 
These files are optimized for real-time performance and fast loading. 
They are specific to an engine and platform and are not checked into source control 
because they can be regenerated by recompiling their assets.

# `Resource Type`
A resource can be one of a collection of avariable types. 
This collection of types are given by a resource.plugins 

Examples of resource types:
* Static Meshes
* Textures
* Character Animations
* etc.

# `Resource.Plugin`
These are libraries that can be downloaded using git from different depots.
They contain a visual studio project which are build to generated the resource compilers,
the descriptors and other elements that the engine needs to create a vaiable resource type.

# `Resource GUID`
A resource GUID is a unique identifier given to eash resource so that it can be refered to 
it in a safe manner. This resource GUID is an interger number with typically 128bits. 
At least this is done for profersional engine such:

* Unity Asset GUIDs = 128bits (Random generated hash)
* Unreal GUID = 128bits (Random generated hash)

Additinally associated with those GUIDs there is meta data such the type of the resource,
So it is fair to say that their cost to uniquely identify a resuource is well beyound 128bits.

However this library does not use its GUID this way, it uses it in the following way:

* 64bit GUID (Randomly generated Hash)
* 64bit Resource Type

These two combine are to generate the 128bit GUID used in this library. This is far less
unique than what Unity and Unreal offers however this pipeline is not meant to be 
use as a store / mass market API. The benefits is both performance and memory.

# `Resource Compiler`
Resource compilers are command-line tools that take assets as input and generate resources for their output. 
They have specific expectations such as command-line parameters and folder organization. 
These expectations are defined by a common set of rules, concents, and organization provided by a resource pipeline
(Which is exactly what this libray does).

## Reasons for Using Command-Line Tools

### Simplicity
* Fewer combinations of third-party libraries required in the editor
* Easier to test and maintain with a smaller, focused codebase
* Clearer division of responsibilities
* Easy and safe to multicore, work across the network as a job farm, etc...

### Stability
* By been a separate process from the editor, preventing data loss
* Provides more ways to generate the resources beyound the editor, useful for updating resource versions

## Examples of Resource Compilers
* Mesh Compiler
* Font Compiler
* Texture Compiler
* etc.

# `Descriptors`
Descriptors also known as meta files, are used by resource compilers to determine what exact actions they should take 
to generate a given resource. There is one descriptor per resource. The descriptors are a set of properties very similar 
to what an entity component would have. It is a matter of fact that these descriptors are structures as well just like 
components. These propertise are serialize using a text file which allows the user to debug any issues.

This library uses folder for descriptors with the extension `.desc` Inside the folder you will find:

* Info.txt - Which contains the basic information of a resource like the name, type, virtual folder, etc...
* Descriptor.txt - Which contains all the properties needed for the resource to compile properly. 
* Icon.dds - This file is not garantee to be there for if it does it means that is the icon to be display in the asset browswer. 

Additional to these files you can also find other files and folders which are unique to that descriptor. 

# `Virtual Resource`

A virtual resource is a resource that was generated by one the the resource compilers stead of a user. 
Which means that this resource does not exist until the parent resource is comopiled. 
An example of this could be the font compiler. This compiler may generated a texture asset which
later will be compile by the texture compiler. 
This allows any compiler to use the entire resource pipeline as well to do their job.

# `Resource Dependency`
A resource may depend on other resources. For instance a material instance may depend in texture resource 
and material resources. These dependencies are track by the system.

## Usage of dependencies
* Know which resources it needs to compile first
* Allows to know which resources are going to end up in the file product.
* Allows to know which resource could be out of date.

There are two kinds of dependencies.
a. No build order dependencies
a. Dependencies that are required to be compiled first.

# `Log files`
When a resource is compiled there may be some log information which it could be used full.
Such Error, Warnings, Speed of compilation, or any other detailed...

# `Asset Editor / Manager`
Assets only exist in the editor side of thing. It is up to the editor to manager things like
descriptors and to compile the assets into resources.

# `Resource Manager`
Resources exist at runtime. They are managed by the resource manager. 
The resource manager is responsible for loading, unloading, and updating resources.

# `Resource Reference`
This is the runtime data structure which holds the actual reference to the resource.
